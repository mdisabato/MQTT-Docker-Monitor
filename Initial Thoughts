    In Home Assistant, add MQTT sensors:

yaml
Copy
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Container State"
      state_topic: "docker/+/+/state"
      value_template: "{{ value_json }}"
    - name: "Container CPU"
      state_topic: "docker/+/+/cpu_percent"
      unit_of_measurement: "%"
    - name: "Container Memory"
      state_topic: "docker/+/+/memory_percent"
      unit_of_measurement: "%"


    For container actions, you can add REST commands in Home Assistant:

yaml
Copy
rest_command:
  docker_container_action:
    url: "http://your-script-host:port/container/{{ endpoint }}/{{ container }}/{{ action }}"
    method: POST

Using the Portainer API instead (as in this solution) is generally more secure since:

    It's already running in your environment
    It has built-in authentication
    It doesn't require exposing the Docker daemon directly


The script talks to the main Portainer instance only. The Portainer server then communicates with the agents on your behalf. This is actually one of the advantages - you only need to configure one connection to your Portainer server, and it handles all the agent communication for you.

This works because when you call the Portainer API with an endpoint ID, Portainer routes that request through its existing connection to the appropriate agent. You can see this in the code where we use endpoints:

    First we get all endpoints from Portainer:

python
Copy
def get_endpoints(self) -> list:
    response = requests.get(f"{self.portainer_url}/api/endpoints", 
                          headers=self.headers)

    Then for each endpoint, we make requests that include the endpoint ID:

python
Copy
def get_containers(self, endpoint_id: int) -> list:
    response = requests.get(
        f"{self.portainer_url}/api/endpoints/{endpoint_id}/docker/containers/json?all=true",
        headers=self.headers
    )

All the actual agent communication is handled by your existing Portainer infrastructure.
